	* debug.[ch]: Remove. No need for our own logging framework, glib
	already has one.

	*.[ch]: Use glib messaging/logging functions instead of debug_*.

	* sqlitecache.c: A small cleanup to get rid of some awfully similar
	looking code.

	* ChangeLog: Start keeping change log.

	* sqlitecache.c (update_primary): Nullify the update info structure,
	so we don't find garbage from it on freeing.
	(update_filelist): Ditto.
	(update_other): Ditto.

	* db.c (yum_db_open): Delete the cache file if the dbversion
	does not match.
